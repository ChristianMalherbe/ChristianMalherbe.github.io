								<!-- Context -->
									<h2>Context</h2>
									<p> Towards the end of their degrees, Engineering Physics students participate in multifaceted capstone projects, meant to serves as culminating academic and intellectual experience showcasing the knowledge students have gained through school and internships up to that point.</p>
									<p> I am currently working on a project sponsored by a UBC ECE professor along with three other group mates. The aim of our project is to create a 1MHz 650V optical-fiber-driven high-side-isolated H-bridge for an induction heater using GaN devices. High-power high-efficiency H-bridges circuits have applications everywhere, including electric cars, induction heaters (our application), and more, and GaN devices are a novel technology which will push them to the next level.  </p>
									<p> Our project is well underway, and we've already spent a lot of time choosing components, meeting with with our sponsor, and diving into the literature on GaN devices and high speed switching. We expect to encounter many challenges such as simulating our circuit, making measurements, false triggering and more, but hope to have a working prototype by March of 2022.</p>
									<p> Please check back here to see more of our progress soon!</p>
