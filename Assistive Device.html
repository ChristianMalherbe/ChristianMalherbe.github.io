									<h2>Context</h2>
									<p>In 2018 during my first year at UBC, I took part in the APSC 100 assistive device competition, along with over 900 other first year engineering students. The aim of the competition is for teams of students to design an assistive device to improve the quality of life for a quadriplegic man with very limited mobility in his arms. We used SolidWorks to design our device and had it 3D printed. We then presented our device in the form of a written document, PowerPoint presentation and a recorded video. </p>
									<p>After many hours of hard work, we were fortunate enough to come in first place out of all first year engineering students at UBC! Please watch the video below for more details.  </p>
